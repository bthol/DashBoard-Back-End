User Story (this is aspirational): Welcome to APPNAME. A technology the enables users to securely store personal performance data to get real-time analytics in a one page customizable/interactive dashboard. After logging in, a user is taken to a dashboard, which will display everything within the application on one easy-to-read page. I know what you’re thinking, “there are lots of dashboard apps already? What makes this one so special?” The greatest limitation to other dashboard apps isn’t their analysis or design. It’s that no one wants to enter the user data to make those analytics useful. In APPNAME, it’s really simple to enter and interact with data. Say, for example, that the user wants to measure their task completion rate in a day. All they have to do is click a button at the top right of the dashboard labeled "user data," and that will reveal forms for data entry, where the user can enter in a projected number of tasks for the day, and a new section of the dashboard will automatically appear with the projected number of tasks, a data visualization, and a button. The user pushes that button every time they complete a task, and progress will be displayed in real-time through the data visualization. APPNAME makes it easy to enter and interact with performance data, so that you can have an objective measure of your performance when work becomes too stressful to accurately judge yourself.
